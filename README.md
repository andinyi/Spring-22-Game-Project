A Game Engine Project I made for my Game Engine Class

The game being rendered and playable on the Project is Flappy Bird

Game Engine is built using GLFW, OpenGL, stbi, and C++

includes a working scoreboard but game closes itself when you touch the pipes
currently not death when dropping past the ground, maybe implement when I have time,
THANKS FOR THE GREAT SEMESTER!
